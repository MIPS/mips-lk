To build and run these sample TEE trusted applications run:

lk/scripts/do-qemumips-malta -p mips-malta-teetest

The ta_test_client and ta_test_client2 trusted applications use the TEE
Internal Client API to open a session with the ta_test_server trusted
application. The ta_test_starter application simulates a REE client opening a
TA session and is used to trigger the start of the test. This setup
demonstrates how the libutee-client library can be used to develop and test TA
code in QEMU without the added complexity of running a hypervisor with REE and
TEE VMs.
