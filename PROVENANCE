The following directories in this repository were initially subtrees tracking
remote repositories.  The remote references are not automatically restored when
cloning.

lk/              - https://github.com/travisg/lk.git
trusty/          - https://android.googlesource.com/trusty/lk/trusty
app/sample/      - https://android.googlesource.com/trusty/app/sample
lib/             - https://android.googlesource.com/trusty/lib
external/headers - https://android.googlesource.com/trusty/external/headers


The initial LK setup was achieved using:
   git remote add -f lk-upstream https://github.com/travisg/lk.git
   git merge -s ours --no-commit lk-upstream/master
   git read-tree -u --prefix=lk/ lk-upstream/master
   git commit

To update LK from upstream:
   git remote add -f lk-upstream https://github.com/travisg/lk.git
   git pull -s recursive -X subtree=lk lk-upstream master


The Google Trusty directories in this repository where originally obtained from
the locations shown above and moved into subtrees. The Trusty codebase in this
repository is no longer actively tracking upstream Trusty changes.
